Entry in Assembly Summer 2019 1k Intro compo.

Thanks to Pungary for the idea of the theme of "Yhen kilon siika" (one
kilo whitefish) in a 1k intro compo. It took 5 years to think about it,
but here it is now. Jumalauta, mik√§ moetkoe.

Technical
=========

I can run the compo version in my "Firefox Quantum 68.0 (64-bit),
Mozilla Firefox for fedora-1.0". No idea about other browsers. Many
will not accept it, for sure.

Made with Javascript, Closure Compiler, and PNGinator. HTML5 Canvas
element, ellipse, and painter's algorithm :).

Plead to Compo Crew
===================

Please, run with fullscreen, and move the mouse away.. The entry is
more fun when the bytes are spent in c.fillText('Yhen kilon siika')
instead of style.cursor='none' ...
