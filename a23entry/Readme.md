** Further credits

As always with anything Javascript, I must specifically thank p01 for
inspiration and learnings about the craziest size minification tricks.
Although, I'm probably not going to use Brotli yet this year.. being a
masochist in that, even though they would've allowed it at Assembly
once again. Thanks to the Compo Crew for communications regarding
Brotli. The tempting 30% more content.. the temptation, the
temptation.. maybe at a later compo.

** The story behind

I have always wanted to make a small demoscene intro about gloomy,
eerie, woods with generated trees. The idea was clarified during
summer holidays 2023 jogging long runs at midnight and looking at
forests against skies after sunset. Streetlights were off to save
energy, and the landscapes were pretty. Another inspiration is the
Vallila print pattern Kelohonka by Tanja Orsjoki. I wanted to get
something similar on screen, animated. Would look nicer with
sunset-colored gradient backgrounds, but, well, can't fit everything
in 1k, can I... with Brotli maybe, but opting out this time.. Attempts
to that direction can be found in the source codes that are available.

Now, being at Assembly, I discover a connection with dear, sometimes
little fuzzy, memories from the certain little forest hill in Pasila
some steps away from the main event... This entry ends up representing
a lot of love to forests, Finnish summer midnights, and good times
with the demoscene community over the years. Remember to vote if you
like it :).

** Tools used

HTML Canvas, Javascript, PNGinator, zopfli, memories of Pasila woods

(No piece of Brotli was eaten this time; maybe at a later compo:))

** Source code

Sources with version history will be published soon after the
demoscene compos have been shown. They will be at my github account
next to Moetkoe from some years back:

https://github.com/puavous/browser1k

( Some tools needed are in https://github.com/puavous/lmad1 )

** Instructions on how to view

Browsers don't allow the PNG compression trick from a file system
source.  Use a web server or insecure browser session without CORS. In
July 2023, the following invocation works for Chrome, makes it
insecure:

"chrome.exe --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=C:\\tmp\\chromeTemp"

Please, go to fullscreen, click once, and move the mouse cursor away
when showing.

I guess the show needs a lot of processing power. I'm developing on a
pretty heavy duty laptop and haven't benchmarked slower machines.
Slowdown and audio crackling is quite likely on lighter equipment.

Actually, 2 hours before the compo deadline I realize that Chrome and
Edge will hick-up at one point if I view a downloaded version. I hope
that the compo version at Assembly can be recorded for example using
the Chrome invocation above if other methods would glitch..
